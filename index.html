  <h2>Short Answer Type Questions</h2>

  <div class="question">1) Define work</div>
  <div class="answer">Work is said to be done when force is applied on a body and it is displaced.</div>

  <div class="question">2) When does a force perform work?</div>
  <div class="answer">When it is applied on a body, and the body tends to move</div>

  <div class="question">3) State two conditions when no work is done?</div>
  <div class="answer">
    i) When the force applied on a body does not move it.<br>
    ii) When the angle between force and displacement is 90°.
  </div>

  <div class="question">4) In which cases work is being done</div>
  <div class="answer">a) No work<br>b) Work is done<br>c) No work<br>d) Work is done</div>

  <div class="question">5) Write the expression for work.</div>
  <div class="answer">Work = Force × Displacement (W = F × D).</div>

  <div class="question">6) What is the SI unit of work?Define it</div>
  <div class="answer">SI unit of work is Joule (J), where 1 J = 1 Newton × 1 meter.</div>

  <div class="question">7)State two  factors on which work depends?</div>
  <div class="answer">i) Force applied on body<br>ii) Distance moved by the body.</div>

  <div class="question">8) Define energy.</div>
  <div class="answer">Energy is defined as the ability to do work.</div>

  <div class="question">9) SI unit of energy?</div>
  <div class="answer">The SI Unit of Energy is Joule (J).</div>

  <div class="question">10) Define one joule of energy</div>
  <div class="answer">If it can do one Joule of work, it has one Joule of energy.</div>

  <div class="question">11) Relation between work and energy?</div>
  <div class="answer">Work is directly related to energy. To do more work, more energy is required.</div>

  <div class="question">12) Name two types of mechanical energy.</div>
  <div class="answer">i) Potential Energy<br>ii) Kinetic Energy</div>

  <div class="question">13) Define Potential Energy (PE).State its SI unit</div>
  <div class="answer">The energy possessed by a body due to its state of rest or position is called Potential Energy.Its SI unit is joule(J)</div>

  <div class="question">14) Give two examples of Potential Energy.</div>
  <div class="answer">a) A hanging fan<br>b) A stretched catapult</div>

  <div class="question">15) Which bucket has greater potential energy: one on ground or one kept on second floor?</div>
  <div class="answer">The bucket on the second floor has greater Potential Energy.</div>

  <div class="question">16) Write the expression for Potential Energy.</div>
  <div class="answer">PE = m × g × h</div>

  <div class="question">17) Define Kinetic Energy (KE).Give one example</div>
  <div class="answer">The energy possessed by a body due to its motion is called Kinetic Energy.<br>Eg-F1 car during race</div>

  <div class="question">18)State two factors affecting Kinetic Energy</div>
  <div class="answer">i) Mass of the body<br>ii) Speed (velocity) of the body</div>

  <div class="question">19) Which toy car has more KE, car A or car B?When A has mass of 200g and B has mass of 500g</div>
  <div class="answer">Toy car B will have greater kinetic energy.</div>

  <div class="question">20) A cyclist doubles his speed. How will his kinetic energy change: Increase or re</div>
  <div class="answer">Kinetic Energy increases.</div>

  <div class="question">21) Expression for KE, explaining the meanings of symbol used</div>
  <div class="answer">KE = ½ × m × v². Where m is mass of the body and v is speed(velocity) of the body</div>

  <div class="question">22) A ball of mass m is moving with a speed of v.What is its kinetic energy?</div>
  <div class="answer">½ m v²</div>

  <div class="question">23Form of energy stored in a wound up spring)</div>
  <div class="answer">Potential Energy</div>

  <div class="question">24)  Which energy is stored wound up spring?<br>a)A moving ball<br>b)A stone at rest on top of the building<br>c)A compressed spring<br>d)A moving bus<br>e)A bullet fired from the gun<br>f)Water flowing in a river<br>g)A stretched rubber band</div>
  <div class="answer">
    a) KE<br>b) PE<br>c) PE<br>d) KE<br>e) KE<br>f) KE<br>g) PE
  </div>

  <div class="question">25)State the energy changes </div>
  <div class="answer">
    i) Electric → Light<br>
    ii) Electric → Heat<br>
    iii) Electric → Sound<br>
    iv) Sound → Electric<br>
    v) Electric → Mechanical<br>
    vi) Mechanical → Electric

  <h2>Long Answer Type Questions</h2>

  <div class="question">1) Refer book</div>
  <div class="answer">It depends on mass of the body and gravitational force (g).</div>

  <div class="question">2) Refer book</div>
  <div class="answer">Body B has greater Potential Energy.</div>

  <div class="question">3)Refer book </div>
  <div class="answer">
    a) Force needed to lift a body = Weight = m × g N<br>
    b) Work done = F × d = m × g × h<br>
    c) Therefore, Potential Energy (PE) = m × g × h J
  </div>

  <div class="question">4)Refer book</div>
  <div class="answer">Yes, a body can have potential energy<br> for example a ball kept on the 10th floor has potential energy due to its height.</div>

  <div class="question">5) Refer book</div>
  <div class="answer">A snowball kept at a hilltop has potential energy. When released, it rolls down as PE converts into KE.</div>

  <div class="question">6)Refer book</div>
  <div class="answer">Potential Energy converts into Kinetic Energy.</div>
